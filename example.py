##you have to rename GIGA1.py main.py to start with it, without help of any other computer!
##on your Ucomputer, with your own keyboard, you can manipulate variables, 'print a file', copy a file or modify it with the help of shell_commands.py.
examples of commands:
a = 5
a ###it return 5

file = open('myfile', 'w')...

sc.cp('main.py', 'test.py', '3', 'name=bob')
sc.view #you have to indicate the name and which lignes in your main.py

import test    #you have to place the file in your lib and add the line to indicate this possible import in your main (you can too import directly a module by your main), to execute the file test.py

Until now, no if, for, while, ..., functions, ...
